                <p>
                    The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. Made up of members John Lennon, Paul McCartney,
                    George Harrison and Ringo Starr. One of the most recogniseable bands of all time and the most influencial on their given genre.

                <h2>Genre</h2>
                <p>
                    The Beatles originated as a skiffle group, which is a genre with influences from 
                    jazz, blues and American folk. The Beatles also embraced 1950s rock and roll
                    and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre, which is a light, highly melodic 
                    style of Beat music. Their repertoire expanded to include a broad variety of pop music
                    which they became quite well known for.

                <h2>Controversy</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the bands career the Beatles have had their share of 
                    controversy. During a tour of the Phillipines they accidentally snubbed 
                    the first lady, who expencted them for breakfast due to different cultures
                    it was considered offensive to turn down the offer and resultd in riots and the 
                    band escaping the country with some difficulty due to the danger posed to them.

                    Another large controversy was also due to comments made by John Lennon about Christianity.
                    <br>"Christianity will go," Lennon had said. "It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about
                     that; I'm right and I will be proved right. Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick 
                     and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me."<br>
                     This caused heavy backlash from religious groups in America and even in the Vatican.
